# jesters

how to run
youll have to install python3
and that should come with pip3

then you can install tornado with

pip3 install tornado

then you can run with

python3 server/main.py

and it should open at either

localhost:3000

or localhost:8888

or localhost:8080


once you have it running in terminal you can go to that url to access the game

and then you can see debug statements by hitting cmd +option+ i in google chrome and finding the console tab

(it's not quite up to date bc i havent had time to push new changes but hopefully it plays well)
